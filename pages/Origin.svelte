<h2>THE ORIGIN OF BDI</h2>

<p>
	I feel that it is important to explain how this theory originated, because doing so might allow
	you to better understand the process from my perspective.
</p>
<p>
	As much as I hate to admit it - I just turned 40 years old, and I am an anime geek. Supposedly,
	that’s more <LinkInfo

	> these days, but I remain sheepish. Regardless, one thing I truly enjoy about the genre is that because
	its plots are usually not at all grounded in reality, it can allow you to consider possibilities that
	you might not otherwise. And in this instance, that is exactly what occurred. One day in the not-so-distant
	past, I was watching a series while my wife was busy working on her college classes. I wish I knew
	the exact date, but (since Netflix decides to erase your previous viewing history if you rewatch something,)
	I do not. What I <em>do</em> know is that it was some time after December 11<sup>th</sup> 2019, since
	that was the date the episode that I was watching was originally available.
</p>
<p>
	In the <LinkInfo
		type="Link"
		title="Netflix > The Seven Deadly Sins"
		href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80050063">series</LinkInfo
	>, there are two opposing gods that command the beings under their reign to battle each other. The
	Supreme Deity, who commands the Goddess Race, is in direct conflict with the Demon King, who
	commands the Demon Clan. One might think that the Goddess Race would be benevolent and good, while
	the Demon Clan would be underhanded and merciless. But as it turns out, (and is common in the
	genre), both sides fight just as dirty. Most belligerents on both sides are willing to exterminate
	the other without pause or mercy, usually because each side is seeking vengeance for past
	atrocities wrought by the hands of their enemy.
</p>
<p>
	The episode I was watching explains how the (up-to-then) four seasons of the show are connected. I
	don’t wish to spoil the plot for anyone in case they wish to watch it, because I highly recommend
	the series if you can get over the overt cheesiness of it. However, the culmination of the plot
	tells the single most tragic love story I have heard in my entire life. In my opinion, the
	suffering in Shakespeare’s tragedies can’t hold a candle to this story. For a moment, it affected
	me emotionally to the point that I actually had to pause the show to process it, mostly because I
	was unprepared for the fact that a cartoon geared for a 14+ audience might include such a tragic
	plot.
</p>
<p>In an episode prior to the one I was watching that day, one of the main characters says this:</p>
<p>
	<strong
		>“As bad as the world may seem, true evil isn’t that common. From what I’ve seen, through those
		I’ve battled till now, everyone has a reason for doing what they do. A guy could be scum, at
		least from my perspective, but that same guy might be someone irreplaceable to my sister. I
		mean, it’s the same for you, isn’t it?”</strong
	>
</p>
<p>
	At that moment, I recalled this quote. Coupled with the plot of two opposing gods, it caused what
	felt like a fuse blowing in my brain. As I sat there, I felt a chill roll down my spine, and it
	seemed as if time stopped for a brief moment. I considered the one man most of us think of when
	the concept of evil is brought up. If you were to ask five random strangers on the street of any
	major city who they thought the most evil person in all of history was, who do you imagine the
	majority, if not all of them, would name?
</p>
<p>
	I imagined that a malevolent higher consciousness could have exploited Adolf Hitler’s sense of
	injustices imposed on Germany after World War I, and his sins of racial/national pride and greed
	for land and resources, to justify committing horrific acts of evil. And to him, he did those
	things with the best intentions. In his own mind, he felt he was absolutely justified in
	everything he did because it was for the good of his own people. By extension, once he started
	down his path, motivated by that pride, wrath, and greed, that allowed for his fellow countrymen
	to also be easily exploited in his wake, since they, too, (either already or eventually) were
	convinced of the same beliefs and justifications. The cascade of those factors could have led to
	what is historically accepted as the worst acts of brutality and genocide in human history.
</p>
<p>
	As I reflected on that possibility, I realized that two opposing gods, each within their own
	separate-but-linked universes, would explain just about <em>everything</em> in terms of
	philosophy, human behavior, and the human condition. It would both resolve the problem of evil
	<em>and</em> allow for God, perhaps even a loving one, to exist at the same time. The realization
	shattered my sense of reality, because it opened the possibility for religion, philosophy, and
	logic to all coexist. But surely, the laws of physics should dictate that this is impossible,
	right? Could another entire universe made of antimatter <em>really</em> exist?
</p>
<p>
	From there, and over the past 3+ years, I began trying to understand what I could of the extremely
	complex laws of physics, and how that thought could be either possible or impossible in terms of
	our actual, testable reality. From the point I started, I knew that relativity imposed the
	restrictions of locality and the speed of light upon us, that quantum mechanics and entanglement
	were extremely strange phenomena that seemed to violate that same locality and speed limit, that
	antimatter exists, and there was baryonic asymmetry in our universe.
</p>
<p>
	However, I fully expected that the more I researched physics, the more I would find that I would
	have to bend or break the rules of reality for this ultra-bizarre dueling gods theory to make any
	sense whatsoever. Quite honestly, that is precisely what I was looking for. I simply would never
	accept a system of belief that would contradict science. If I could prove to myself that the
	construct was impossible (or even highly improbable) within the laws of physics, I could dismiss
	it and return to my agnostic beliefs. It would mean that my worldview could remain what it was,
	and I would not have to change. I could go back to my quasi-nihilistic ideology wherein God almost
	certainly does not exist, we all evolved and exist due to countless throws of the dice and random
	happenstance, and the only thing that really links any of us is that we are all made up from the
	same cosmic goo. Above all, I could go back to believing that the only thing that really mattered
	in anyone’s life, including my own, is individual happiness. I could go back to being the selfish
	person I had been my entire life. Somewhat comically, I was experiencing effects of <LinkInfo

	> associated with my own thought experiment.
</p>
<p>
	I never expected or dreamed that the more research I did, I would find out that the concept is not
	just possible, but that the physics of our universe seem to completely align with what I imagined.
	So well, in fact, that to me, it seems as if our entire reality might have been purpose-built for
	it. I found a universe in a complete state of imbalance, and the theory I came up with looked as
	if it would complete the equation. At that point, I had started to see that this might be a viable
	candidate that could truly explain everything, and my beliefs began to shift.
</p>
<p>
	Then, the more I learned about out the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, I felt that the
	one that I had come up with explains the absolute most in terms of logical reasons behind the
	strange behaviors of physics and reality, and allows for the complete unification of what we know
	about physical reality with both philosophy and faith. By this time, I was beginning to reshape my
	own beliefs with what I had found. However, I was not yet at the stage that I truly wished to try
	and change anyone else’s mind, other than anecdotal banter with friends and family. But as I
	continued to explore further, more consistencies still kept occurring to me.
</p>
<p>
	One issue I have considered (at great length) is that by looking at physics from a reversed angle,
	meaning that I am trying to figure out if an idea is possible within the currently-known laws and
	theories, I run the risk of introducing a rather large amount of cognitive bias. I could simply be
	seeing functions and patterns that do not truly exist, simply because that is what I am looking
	for. While I admit that is true, the reasons behind <em>why</em> the quantum world behaves the way
	it does has stumped the greatest minds of our planet, including intellectual giants such as
	Einstein, Bohr, Feynman, Heisenberg, Bell, Hawking, and so many more, for over a century. The very
	people who discovered the quantum nature of our universe never expected reality to behave in that
	way. The idea of particles being physically real, and having defined and indivisible physical
	pieces, was what the best scientists of the 19<sup>th</sup> century expected to find once their tools
	were advanced enough to divide that matter and view it. In the early part of the century after, what
	they found instead was interesting, but also both confusing and discomforting.
</p>
<p>
	So, then: why does this quantum world exist? Is it the <em>only</em> possible way our macro
	reality could have been described? Or, could an extremely similar version of our current macro
	reality be constructed without such a complicated and strange underlying mechanism? Put another
	way, if we conclude that there may have been multiple ways to “skin the cat” and come up with a
	very similar result, then why would

	<em>are</em> simpler methods, then the only logical reason for the more-complex option
	<em>must</em> be that those complexities serve multiple purposes, rather than serving only as our reality’s
	LEGO bricks. Therefore, I feel that this is one possible theory that provides logical functions for
	the complexities in question.
</p>
<p>
	The one aspect that really solidified my desire to communicate this to others, though, comes down
	to one deciding factor: from the best of my understanding, the theories this framework is built
	upon do not seem to contradict each other. They all seem to paint the same general picture of
	reality. Any current inconsistencies between them could be resolved in ways that would not exclude
	this theory. And in that sense, from the best I can discern, this theory itself is also (mostly)
	self-consistent.
</p>
<div class="indent-8">
	Let’s try this from yet another angle. If you are an engineer, scientist, or physicist, I present
	you with the following challenge: Design it better. If you assume that our reality is not a
	competition between two dueling GCs, then taking what we know of our universe, how would you have
	improved upon its design in order to make it into one? Design the game under the following
	assumptions:
	<ol class="list-decimal pl-8 pr-8 pt-4 pb-4 indent-2">
		<li>
			The game is a competition to create a universe with the greatest amount of conscious life.
		</li>
		<li>
			The game should be for two GCs with huge amounts of computational power, who can interact with
			the game constructively and destructively.
		</li>
		<li>
			The game should last a very long time, because such beings would have many billions or
			trillions of years at their disposal.
		</li>
		<li>
			The GCs are not permitted to directly communicate with their conscious creations, as that
			would be cheating (an automatic loss).
		</li>
		<li>
			There should be a subtle breadcrumb trail that would allow the created conscious life to
			figure out the reality of the game, since that is the goal. If a GC is able to help conscious
			life survive long enough to understand the truth of the game, the odds of winning increase.
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<p>
	Based on these requirements, how would you do it better? I ask because personally, I am at a
	complete loss. I certainly cannot come up with any better way. Viewing the known laws of physics
	from this perspective, I feel that the engineering behind it is beyond absolute and utter
	elegance. It is the embodiment of perfection, in every conceivable way.
</p>
<div class="indent-8">
	Trust me, I can understand that you probably still feel it is ridiculous that two highly-advanced
	consciousnesses, controlling two entangled universes, could be the driving forces behind all
	reality. However, consider some of the major competing interpretations of quantum mechanics:

				excerpt="The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts that the universal wavefunction is objectively real, and that there is no wave function collapse. This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some “world” or universe. In contrast to some other interpretations, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, the evolution of reality as a whole in MWI is rigidly deterministic: 9  and local. Many-worlds is also called the relative state formulation or the Everett interpretation, after physicist Hugh Everett, who first proposed it in 1957. Bryce DeWitt popularized the formulation and named it many-worlds in the 1970s.

				In many-worlds, the subjective appearance of wavefunction collapse is explained by the mechanism of quantum decoherence. Decoherence approaches to interpreting quantum theory have been widely explored and developed since the 1970s, and have become quite popular.

				It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see Measurement problem)."

It is one of the oldest of numerous proposed interpretations of quantum mechanics, as features of it date to the development of quantum mechanics during 1925–1927, and it remains one of the most commonly taught.
				<br /><br />
				There is no definitive historical statement of what the Copenhagen interpretation is. There are some fundamental agreements and disagreements between the views of Bohr and Heisenberg. For example, Heisenberg emphasized a sharp “cut” between the observer (or the instrument) and the system being observed, while Bohr offered an interpretation that is independent of a subjective observer or measurement or collapse, which relies on an “irreversible” or effectively irreversible process, which could take place within the quantum system.
				<br /><br />
				Features common to Copenhagen-type interpretations include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic, with probabilities calculated using the Born rule, and the principle of complementarity, which states that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties that cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously. Moreover, the act of “observing” or “measuring” an object is irreversible, and no truth can be attributed to an object, except according to the results of its measurement. Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists' mental arbitrariness."

	I appreciate the fact that two dueling GCs sounds, well, fairly crazy. But ask yourself: Really,
	is it much more so than any of the others? The quantum world, and reality itself, are both
	mind-bogglingly strange. I feel strongly that because of that fact, there will never be an
	explanation that does not seem outlandish. All interpretations will seem crazy to a degree, and we
	may have no choice but to pick the ones that seem the <em>least</em> illogical and put them to the
	test. Apart from our ability to do that, perhaps we simply pick the one that sounds the most logical,
	and/or makes us feel the best, to believe.
