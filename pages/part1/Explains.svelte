<h3>WHAT WOULD PART I EXPLAIN?</h3>

<p>
	Well, from my own viewpoint, this is easy. Since I started to view the universe through this lens,
	it seems as if everything that is (and has ever been) seems to simply fall into place. But please
	allow me to explain a few of the bigger pieces to elucidate. This will also allow me to explain
	how this interpretation might be possible within the constraints of reality.
</p>
<p>
	The first scientific mystery that we could easily explain using this theory would be the question
	of why the quantum realm, and its associated “spookiness” of entanglement, both exist at all: they
	have logical functions, as that is how each GC performs moves within the construct. Famously, <LinkInfo

		In fact, the nature of Einstein’s argument was that there might be more to the Universe than we can presently observe, and if we could understand the rules we have not yet uncovered, perhaps what appears to be randomness to us here might reveal a deeper, non-random truth. Although this position has not yielded useful results, explorations of the fundamentals of quantum physics continues to be an active area of research, successfully ruling out a number of interpretations involving “hidden variables” present in the Universe."

It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy."

	>, is unbelievably successful at predicting how subatomic particles interact and behave. From our
	observations until now, the universe is <em>clearly</em> based on randomness and pure chance.
</p>
<p>
	Over time, and with the more I learn, I have come to align with Einstein’s sentiment, because I
	feel that we <em>all</em> have been missing half the picture. If you can accept that this
	interpretation could be possible, the quantum effects we know we exist within become an underlying
	part of our existence and have a defined purpose.
	<em>Throws of dice transform into moves on a chessboard</em>. The pure chance and randomness that
	we encounter when we do our best to observe the nearly-infinitesimal structures of our universe
	become the opposite; what we are witnessing instead is opposing forces attempting to best each
	other. The issue is that we cannot easily observe or measure the very small effects that occur on
	the macroscopic level as a result of each instantaneous, electron-scale-interaction. We observe
	waveforms in a state of superposition simply because the query to determine the state has not yet
	been performed. The instant an interaction occurs, the query is performed, and a state is chosen!
</p>
<p>
	Second, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle has an important logical purpose within this
	framework. It means that as either GC selects eigenstates, they cannot back the other GC into a
	fully deterministic corner and thereby limit the range of possibilities they could select. The
	more defined a property becomes, the more undefined its complementary property becomes. The amount
	of uncertainty in the universe is conserved, and there is always the same amount available after
	each move/interaction.

		excerpt="The field of quantum gravity is actively developing, and theorists are exploring a variety of approaches to the problem of quantum gravity, the most popular being M-theory and loop quantum gravity. All of these approaches aim to describe the quantum behavior of the gravitational field. This does not necessarily include unifying all fundamental interactions into a single mathematical framework. However, many approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory, try to develop a framework that describes all fundamental forces. Such a theory is often referred to as a theory of everything. Others, such as loop quantum gravity, make no such attempt; instead, they make an effort to quantize the gravitational field while it is kept separate from the other forces.<br /><br />
		One of the difficulties of formulating a quantum gravity theory is that direct observation of quantum gravitational effects is thought to only appear at length scales near the Planck scale, around 10<sup>−35</sup> meters, a scale far smaller, and hence only accessible with far higher energies, than those currently available in high energy particle accelerators. Therefore, physicists lack experimental data which could distinguish between the competing theories which have been proposed.<br /><br />
		Thought experiment approaches have been suggested as a testing tool for quantum gravity theories. In the field of quantum gravity there are several open questions - e.g., it is not known how spin of elementary particles sources gravity, and thought experiments could provide a pathway to explore possible resolutions to these questions, even in the absence of lab experiments or physical observations."

	uncertainty, and thus, spacetime emerged into existence. This theory makes this prediction because
	without uncertainty, the competition between GCs cannot take place, and the logical reasons for both

The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for matter and antimatter. Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in baryogenesis. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon, which has been described as “one of the great mysteries in physics”."

		excerpt="Physics relies on conservation laws, which govern how energy and information can change within a system. The conservation of energy states that the total amount of energy in a closed system (like the universe) must stay constant. In classical physics, information can be copied and deleted, but in quantum mechanics, the conservation of quantum information means that information cannot be created or destroyed. This is demonstrated by the no-cloning and no-deleting theorems. The no-hiding theorem further shows that the wave function, which contains all relevant information about a physical system, is conserved as it moves from one Hilbert space to another during unitary time evolution. The conservation of entropy in quantum systems also suggests that information is conserved, as quantum states and mixed states (a combination of quantum states) remain unchanged during unitary evolution."

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks."

Proponents of the anthropic principle argue that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life, since if either had been different, we would not have been around to make observations.
