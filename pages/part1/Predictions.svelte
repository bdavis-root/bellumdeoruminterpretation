<h3>PART I PREDICTIONS</h3>

<h4>PREDICTION I: AN ANTIVERSE EXISTS</h4>

<p>
	This one should come as no surprise if you read the previous page. This interpretation predicts
	the existence of a universe (antiverse) that is essentially a negative image of our own, which is
	made of antimatter from our frame of reference, and in which time runs backward relative to our
	perspective. This means that if we could make a theoretical time machine and travel back all the
	way to the big bang, and then keep going <em>further</em> back, we might end up in the antiverse. While
	time kept running backwards for our frame of reference, we would witness the birth of the antiverse
	in forward time, relative to that universe.

<h4>PREDICTION II: SEVERAL CORE THEORIES OF PHYSICS WILL NOT BE VIOLATED</h4>

<div class="indent-8">
	This theory is built upon several key theories of physics. If these theories are shown to be
	violated, it would mean core parts of this theory would need to be remodeled, reconsidered, or
	abandoned. These include:

It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age."

It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy."

				Such variable pairs are known as complementary variables or canonically conjugate variables; and, depending on interpretation, the uncertainty principle limits to what extent such conjugate properties maintain their approximate meaning, as the mathematical framework of quantum physics does not support the notion of simultaneously well-defined conjugate properties expressed by a single value. The uncertainty principle implies that it is in general not possible to predict the value of a quantity with arbitrary certainty, even if all initial conditions are specified."

				excerpt="In physical cosmology, the baryon asymmetry problem, also known as the matter asymmetry problem or the matter–antimatter asymmetry problem, is the observed imbalance in baryonic matter (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and antibaryonic matter in the observable universe. Neither the standard model of particle physics, nor the theory of general relativity provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe is neutral with all conserved charges. The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for matter and antimatter. Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in baryogenesis. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon, which has been described as “one of the great mysteries in physics”."

				excerpt="The no-hiding theorem states that if information is lost from a system via decoherence, then it moves to the subspace of the environment and it cannot remain in the correlation between the system and the environment. This is a fundamental consequence of the linearity and unitarity of quantum mechanics. Thus, information is never lost. This has implications in black hole information paradox and in fact any process that tends to lose information completely. The no-hiding theorem is robust to imperfection in the physical process that seemingly destroys the original information."

<p>
	Obviously, there are some discrepancies between some of these theories. For example, we know that
	there are issues to be resolved between quantum field theory and relativity, so those might be
	modified if a solid theory is able to merge the two. For the no-hiding theorem, this theory
	predicts that the black hole information paradox will somehow be <LinkInfo

		hoverExcerpt="When predictions of quantum mechanics and general relativity are combined, the math indicates that information could be destroyed. This violates quantum unitary, so it is now generally believed that information is somehow preserved."
		excerpt="Since many different states can have the same mass, charge and angular momentum this suggests that many initial physical states could evolve into the same final state. Therefore, information about the details of the initial state would be permanently lost. However, this violates a core precept of both classical and quantum physics—that, in principle, the state of a system at one point in time should determine its value at any other time. Specifically, in quantum mechanics the state of the system is encoded by its wave function. The evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that the wave function at any instant of time can be used to determine the wave function either in the past or the future.<br /><br />
		It is now generally believed that information is preserved in black-hole evaporation. This means that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct whereas Hawking's original argument that relied on general relativity must be corrected."

		excerpt="In theories of quantum gravity, the graviton is the hypothetical quantum of gravity, an elementary particle that mediates the force of gravitational interaction.

In string theory, believed by some to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity, the graviton is a massless state of a fundamental string."
