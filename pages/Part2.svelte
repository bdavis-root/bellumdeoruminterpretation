<h2>PART II: QUANTUM CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

<p>
	Part II and its predictions will be controversial, because most neuroscientists disagree with this
	premise. They believe that the brain is too “warm, wet, and noisy” for quantum computations to
	occur within it. However, I disagree; I believe it likely that what enables biological life to be
	conscious is the ability of the brain (or nervous system) to utilize quantum entanglement and
	superposition to process data.
