<h2>CONCERNING THIS THEORY</h2>

<p>
	Once any work makes its way into the open, and especially onto the internet, it tends toward
	becoming its own “being”. While I will be doing all within my power to make sure the following
	principles gain traction while I am still around, none of us is permanent. Therefore, the
	following are my wishes concerning this theory:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-8 pr-8 pt-4 pb-4">
	<li>
		<em>True</em> science, following the scientific method, is the only way an intelligent consciousness
		may discern objective truth. I will refer to this theory as “the truth” in quotes for that reason
		– it is only actually the truth if science can provide evidence to support the theory.
	</li>
	<li>
		While I am a firm believer in science and the scientific method, I am (unfortunately) not a
		physicist or a mathematician. I need the help of the scientific community to consider this
		theory, and to prove or disprove its assertions.
	</li>
	<li>
		As new discoveries are made, or as evidence is presented that contradicts the theory,
		adjustments should be made, if that is possible. If predictions made herein are disproven, they
		should be summarily discarded.
	</li>
	<li>
		Should the entire theory be disproven via incontrovertible, objective evidence, it should
		absolutely be abandoned. It is not my intent to create further <LinkInfo

			excerpt="Pseudoscience consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that claim to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method. Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory, exaggerated or unfalsifiable claims; reliance on confirmation bias rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; absence of systematic practices when developing hypotheses; and continued adherence long after the pseudoscientific hypotheses have been experimentally discredited."

			excerpt="Philosophers debate the nature of science and the general criteria for drawing the line between scientific theories and pseudoscientific beliefs, but there is general agreement on examples such as ancient astronauts, climate change denial, dowsing, evolution denial, astrology, alternative medicine, ufology, and creationism. There are implications for health care, the use of expert testimony, and weighing environmental policies. Addressing pseudoscience is part of science education and developing scientific literacy."

		The ideas presented here are intended for the common good. Any use of these ideas for the
		material gain or cynical benefit of any particular group would be in direct conflict with the
		ideas presented here.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is likely no way we will ever really know the full, complete truth of our existence - at
		least not while we live it. That makes some (or most) of the theory currently unprovable.
		Despite this, we should never cease imagining possibilities that do not directly contradict
		scientific findings, and we should remain diligent in seeking all we can know and prove.
