<h2>THE GC’S HANDBOOK</h2>

<p>
	The purpose of this section is to give some insight on how the principles in this theory could be
	used to guide both development and destruction of life. By doing so, the intent is to show how
	these actions might have shaped our own universe, how they might have shaped us, and how they
	might continue to affect us.
</p>
<h3>HOW TO CREATE AND NURTURE CONSCIOUS LIFE</h3>

<p>If you were a GC, how would you go about creating and nurturing conscious life?</p>
<p>
	Obviously, providing life with an opportunity to evolve and flourish would be your first goal. You
	would have to use your resources to create worlds which could serve as life's cradles. You would
	want to try and keep matter from flying off too far into empty space to create those worlds. Then,
	you would do your best to guide evolution through mutations and adaptations favorable to species’
	environments, starting from basic life forms and progressing through complex, conscious beings,
	and from there, true intelligence.
</p>
<p>
	As humans, we have certainly come a long way since our humble beginnings. Using us as a model, if
	you were a GC trying to help your planets’ intelligent inhabitants survive, it would probably be a
	great idea to try and guide the development of <LinkInfo

		excerpt="The cardinal virtues are four virtues of mind and character in both classical philosophy and Christian theology. They are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. They form a virtue theory of ethics. The term cardinal comes from the Latin cardo (hinge); virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life."

	that benefit their societies as a whole.

		title="Wikipedia > Moral universalism"
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_universalism#:~:text=Moral%20universalism%20(also,moral%20relativism."
		hoverExcerpt="The position that some system ethics applies universally for all similarly situated individuals, regardless of culture, race, sex, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other distinguishing feature."
		excerpt="Moral universalism (also called moral objectivism) is the meta-ethical position that some system of ethics, or a universal ethic, applies universally, that is, for “all similarly situated individuals”, regardless of culture, race, sex, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other distinguishing feature. Moral universalism is opposed to moral nihilism and moral relativism."
		>Moral universalism</LinkInfo
	>, ethics, and by extension, a system of justice, are all good ideas to encourage because those
	concepts and practices help your beings to mitigate the negative and destructive behavior that is
	influenced by your opponent. Within this theory, I would think it could be possible-to-probable
	that the 10 commandments may have been written with divine inspiration from the PGC. The
	principles therein lay a foundation for our success as a species, especially at the time they were
	written.
</p>
<p>
	If you were a GC, you would want to do your best to discourage degenerative and dysgenic behavior
	that both serve to shorten the lifespans of your creations, as well as reduce the possibility that
	they can produce viable and healthy offspring. You might encourage them to develop religion, as
	any that follows basic moral and ethical guidelines could be generally positive for societies that
	are not technologically-advanced enough for science to explain their origins. Even though a
	religion they develop may not be the whole story, it can be grounded with principles that allow
	their society to flourish. Even threats of eternal damnation may have a net-overall-positive
	effect on society if it encourages enough people to adhere to a religion, and therefore the morals
	and ethics thereof.
</p>
<p>
	Encouraging scientific curiosity and the pursuit of wisdom would also be helpful. By fostering a
	sense of wonder, you could allow your beings to explore their surroundings to think of better ways
	to overcome the obstacles in their path. If your goal is to guide your beings into figuring out
	“the truth”, science is the path towards that goal. Giving them the intelligence to change their
	situations for the better allows them to expand the mass of their collective consciousness. In
	turn, that allows the few to think of ways to help the many in their tribes, cities, and nations.
	Eventually, that technology makes its way to the masses through the exchange of ideas. Science
	also has another fundamental purpose – it allows the possibility that your conscious beings can
	agree on what is real. By encouraging them to engineer repeatable experiments, your beings might
	be able to come to a consensus on what exists versus what is conjecture, misinformation, or
	fantasy.
</p>
<p>
	Along the lines of the virtues of prudence, justice, and temperance, guiding your intelligent
	beings into eventually accepting each other as allies or equals would also be desirable. Once they
	advance to a certain point, the weapons they have at their disposal will be capable of destroying
	all (or a large percentage of) complex life on their planet. From then on, the only hope for their
	continued survival is if they hold back when conflict occurs. Total war could become a death
	sentence for all and must be avoided. The best possible outcome would be to foster a spirit of
	cooperation between intelligent beings, so they could work together to overcome obstacles rather
	than expending energy and resources waging (or preparing for) war.
</p>
<p>
	The final step – one, we as humans, have certainly not achieved – would be to encourage ideals and
	behaviors that allow them to exist in a sustainable balance with their own environment. If the
	dominant form(s) of life on the planet decide to keep overproducing and consuming resources at an
	unsustainable rate, they will eventually destroy the ecosystems and empty the resource reserves
	their very lives depend upon.
</p>
<h3>HOW TO LIMIT AND DESTROY CONSCIOUS LIFE</h3>

<p>
	On the other end of the spectrum, how would you go about limiting, sabotaging, and destroying your
	opponent’s conscious life?
</p>
<div class="indent-8">
	Your first order of business would be to use your abilities to spread out (dilute) the matter in
	your opponent’s OU as much as possible. Doing so serves several purposes:
	<ul class="list-disc p-4 pl-8 indent-0">
		<li>
			It reduces the amount of hydrogen that can coalesce into stars. Those stars are necessary to
			generate the heavy elements and energy necessary for life.
		</li>
		<li>
			It accelerates the process of heat death, at which point no more energy would be available to
			power conscious life.
		</li>
		<li>
			It spreads any out any life that does manage to exist as much as possible. This makes it very
			difficult for civilizations to contact each other (and possibly work together) due to the
			universal speed limit.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="indent-8">
	After that, your moves would best be utilized by trying to cause disasters (asteroid strikes,
	gamma ray bursts, novas, supervolcanoes, etc.) to the worlds that could support life. If those
	attempts are unsuccessful, you could then turn to sabotaging evolution in a couple of ways:
	<ul class="list-disc p-4 pl-8 indent-0">
		<li>
			You can use your energy to guide genetic mutations that would be detrimental to species’
			existence, rather than helpful.
		</li>
		<li>
			Through advancing infectious disease, you can utilize a planet’s less-complex life to kill off
			more-complex life.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="indent-8">
	But the stakes get higher and the “fun” really begins once that life starts to become conscious,
	and your opponent’s beings begin to develop intelligence. Their reliance on quantum computations
	for that intelligence makes subverting them even easier. At that stage, you can start influencing
	their thoughts more directly, allowing you the possibility to sway them to engage in behaviors
	such as the <LinkInfo

		hoverExcerpt="The capital vices or cadinal sins within Christian teachings, include pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth."
		excerpt="The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Although they are not directly mentioned in the Bible, there are parallels with the seven things God is said to hate in the Book of Proverbs. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give rise to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth, which are contrary to the seven capital virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat)."

		<li>
			Exploiting their genetic, cultural, religious, and ideological differences to cause fractures
			and divisions.

		<li>
			Utilizing the above divisions, with or without the additional motivation of resource

		</li>
		<li>
			Using their religion, fear, and hubris against them by causing them to reject science and

			Then, as they continue to develop technology, you can also use that against them:
			<ul>
				<li>
					First, by making their initial instinct to weaponize any new technology. Referring back to
					the second main bullet point, this allows them to devise methods to exterminate each other
					more efficiently.
				</li>
				<li>
					Second, by encouraging them to disseminate misinformation (starting from the spoken word,
					and progressing through the digital age, when that misinformation can spread virally).
					This erodes trust and causes them to question each other and reality itself.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>
	These same tactics work no matter how complex life becomes, and whether that life is natural or
	artificial, since you can use the same tactics against a conscious quantum AGI that you would use
	for fully biological life. You can cause them to destroy themselves, each other, and their
	technology. Best possible case: you cause them to unleash weapons that sterilize their homeworld,
	causing your opponent to start evolution all over. If you are lucky, this could mean that by the
	time any intelligent life <em>was</em> able to evolve again, the star that feeds life on that world
	would no longer be in its main sequence, and further intelligent life would become impossible (such
	in our case, the Sun becoming a red giant).
</p>
<p>
	If you are unable to cause them to annihilate each other, you can instead simply delay them long
	enough so that they run out of resources before they can expand beyond their homeworld. Your
	objective here might be to encourage <LinkInfo
