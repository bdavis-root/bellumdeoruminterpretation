<h4>WHAT WOULD PART II EXPLAIN?</h4>

<p>
	Combining Part I with Part II, the most obvious and important philosophical question we can answer
	at least a portion of would be the <LinkInfo
		type="Link"
		title="Wikipedia > Meaning of life"
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life">meaning of life</LinkInfo
	> – a question that has burdened humanity for as long as we have existed. Under this theory, consciousness
	has a clear and defined purpose, and that purpose is to propagate through the universe the best that
	we are able. The more we, the conscious beings of our universe, grow, learn, and flourish, the more
	it helps our PGC to win. For us, that means we get to experience life and our universe, and in return,
	we are to do our best to resist the forces of the AGC that intend to destroy us.
</p>
<p>
	We can also easily answer the <LinkInfo
		title="Wikipedia > Problem of evil"
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#:~:text=The%20problem%20of,David%20Hume."
		hoverExcerpt="The problem of evil is the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil and suffering with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient God."
		excerpt="The problem of evil is the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil and suffering with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient God. There are currently differing definitions of these concepts. The best known presentation of the problem is attributed to the Greek philosopher Epicurus. It was popularized by David Hume."
		>problem of evil</LinkInfo
	>. If you are religious, looking at evil from the perspective of only our own proverse, it would
	seem as though the Jewish/Christian/Muslim concept of God or Allah versus Satan or Iblis exists.
	God/Allah creates in our universe, while Satan/Iblis is the personification of evil that tries to
	silence and eliminate life. However, if we view both OUs as one whole, we might see instead that
	there are two opposing peers who <em>both</em> create and <em>both</em> destroy.
</p>
<p>
	For me personally, this was one of the fundamental reasons why classical religion was so difficult
	to accept. I absolutely <em>refused</em> to believe that a loving god would make humans intrinsically
	evil, imbue them with free will, and then punish them for all eternity if they gave into that evil
	without repentance. I also rejected the idea that a lesser god would exist solely for the purpose of
	malevolence. I find believing in pure evil difficult – I believe that most people feel that they are
	in the right (or at least justified), even when they commit horrific acts we collectively describe
	as evil.
</p>
<p>
	Either GC would be theoretically capable of creating a perfect universe, in which there would not
	be evil or suffering. Such a universe would have no need for quantum mechanics, however, because
	there would be no competition between peers. I believe that instead, the GCs have ceded full
	control of the proverse/antiverse pair, because a competition is infinitely more interesting than
	a sandbox of one's own creation.
</p>
<p>
	Within this interpretation, what we perceive as human (or universal/intrinsic) evil would really
	be direct results of the AGC executing moves in a way that benefits themself most, by influencing
	or reinforcing negative behaviors. This direct negative influence into our consciousness could
	also explain why the intelligence of an animal is often proportional to their propensity to
	display behavior that could be classified as evil, such as the case with <LinkInfo

This is in contrast to the “easy problems” of explaining the physical systems that give humans and other animals the ability to discriminate, integrate information, and so forth. These problems are seen as relatively easy because all that is required for their solution is to specify the mechanisms that perform such functions.

The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective quālis (Latin pronunciation: [ˈkʷaːlɪs]) meaning “of what sort” or “of what kind” in a specific instance, such as “what it is like to taste a specific apple—this particular apple now”.

	Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness of an evening sky.

	The next possibility is even more strange. The prediction regarding our brains being
	quantum-classical hybrids could explain altered states of consciousness during meditation, sensory
	deprivation, and even the use of psychedelic drugs. During both meditation and sensory
	deprivation, the objective is to calm and quiet the parts of the brain that generally deal with
	normal, day-to-day stresses and stimuli. Meditation accomplishes this through practicing

		excerpt="The heartbeat is not just the motion of an organ within our body. Rather, the heart, like many other parts of our body, is engaged in two-way communication with the brain — the organs both send each other signals. We see this when the heart reacts to various phenomena such as pain, attention, and motivation. Additionally, the heartbeat can be tied to short-term memory and aging. 
	<br /><br />
	As the heart beats, it generates a signal called the heartbeat potential, or HEP. With each peak of the HEP, the researchers saw a corresponding spike in the NMR signal, which corresponds to the interactions among proton spins. This signal could be a result of entanglement, and witnessing it might indicate there was indeed a non-classical intermediary.  
	<br /><br />
	“The HEP is an electrophysiological event, like alpha or beta waves,” Kerskens explains. “The HEP is tied to consciousness because it depends on awareness.” Similarly, the signal indicating entanglement was only present during conscious awareness, which was illustrated when two subjects fell asleep during the MRI. When they did, this signal faded and disappeared. "
