<h4>PREDICTION I: YOUR BRAIN CONTAINS A QUANTUM COMPUTER</h4>

		excerpt="Quantum neural networks are computational neural network models which are based on the principles of quantum mechanics. The first ideas on quantum neural computation were published independently in 1995 by Subhash Kak and Ron Chrisley, engaging with the theory of quantum mind, which posits that quantum effects play a role in cognitive function. However, typical research in quantum neural networks involves combining classical artificial neural network models (which are widely used in machine learning for the important task of pattern recognition) with the advantages of quantum information in order to develop more efficient algorithms."

		>quantum tunneling</LinkInfo
	>. You can only fit an electron in a given amount of space, otherwise, tunneling makes it more
	likely the electron will “pop” out of its electrical switch and end up somewhere unexpected,
	resulting in compute errors. Even if we could pack transistors tighter, there is no current (pun
	somewhat intended) way we could come close to the energy

		excerpt="If the human brain were a computer, it would be the greenest computer on Earth.<br /><br />
		The basis for the brain’s greenness is its ultra-high computational efficiency; that is, it can generate a tremendous amount of computational output for the very little power it draws. Studies have shown the brain has higher computational power efficiency than electronic computers by orders of magnitude."

	any modern machine, and consume less energy (which also largely avoids the problem of overheating).

	Compared to current classical computers, we know that <LinkInfo

		hoverExcerpt="A computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to compute data."
		excerpt="A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern “classical” computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely-used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical."
		>quantum computers</LinkInfo
	> can offer vastly faster processing for certain types of problems. Referring back to the idea that
	the quantum realm is our true, underlying computational reality, (and vastly oversimplifying quantum
	computing’s complexities,) this means that in quantum computing, we can exploit entanglement and superposition
	to borrow compute cycles from the compute machine that runs our reality. Instead of computing one answer
	at a time, we can compute several answers to the same problem simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
	At the time of this writing (early 2023), quantum computing is still in its technological infancy.
	As such, we are still developing the techniques and algorithms that allow quantum computers to
	compute general problems more quickly than classical computers, but I am confident that given
	enough time and engineering, a hybrid between quantum architecture and classical architecture will
	eventually outclass any machine that can utilize only one or the other. The first 2-qubit quantum
	computer was designed in 1998 (23 years ago) while the first transistor computer was built in 1955
	(68 years ago). If we use that timeframe as a comparison, that is analogous to looking at today’s
	quantum computers compared to the mainframe dinosaurs of 1984. The fastest computer on Earth at
	that time was <LinkInfo

	Max has an A-16 processor capable of 2 TFLOPS – 5,263 times faster – with a power consumption of
	just 3 watts. This translates to an efficiency improvement by a factor of 287.5 <em>million</em>.

Scholes and Aarat Kalra of Princeton University used lasers to excite molecules within tubulins, causing a prolonged excitation to diffuse through microtubules further than expected, which did not occur when repeated under anesthesia. However, diffusion results have to be interpreted carefully, since even classical diffusion can be very complex due to the wide range of length scales in the fluid filled extracellular space."

	In terms of this full theory, this can be somewhat of a scary prospect. What this would mean is

		excerpt="Startling evidence to support belief in the role of the unconscious in decision-making was demonstrated in an experiment by a group of scientists led by John-Dylan Haynes from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. Using fMRI brain scans, these researchers were able to predict participants’ decisions as many as seven seconds before the subjects had consciously made the decisions. As the researchers concluded in Nature Neuroscience, “Many processes in the brain occur automatically and without involvement of our consciousness. This prevents our mind from being overloaded by simple routine tasks. But when it comes to decisions, we tend to assume they are made by our conscious mind. This is questioned by our current findings.”"

	that your brain makes decisions several seconds before you are even consciously aware of that decision.
	Unfortunately, this throws up questions about whether free will even exists. Personally, I believe
	we still have free will, and perhaps it is more likely to exist in the classical side of our brains.
</p>
<p>
	If this interpretation is correct, it quite literally means that there is a force subtly
	attempting to affect your thoughts this very moment, trying to persuade you to stop wasting your
	time considering this. The reason it is doing so is because if you did, you would be advancing its
	own interests by doing so. That very same force is trying to convince me that I am wrong as I am
	in the process of typing this very sentence; telling me that out of all the people that ever
	lived, and all the people on this planet that are far more intelligent than I, how could I
	possibly see connections that no one else does? By the same token, it would also (hopefully) mean
	there is another force guiding you to keep reading in order to consider the theory. And I feel
	that same force is guiding me to keep writing, despite what I assure you, is a very real sense of
	self-doubt.

<h4>PREDICTION II: A QUANTUM-HYBRID AGI COULD BECOME CONSCIOUS</h4>

<p>
	If the former prediction is correct, then the inverse would likely be true as well. If a
	sufficiently-advanced hybrid quantum/classical machine was created with neural-network design
	similar to our own brains, and it then was programmed with methods for AGI, it might spontaneously
	become (or inherently be) conscious. If this were to occur, it could lead to the beginning phases

According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a “runaway reaction” of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an “explosion” in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence."

	>
	and the extermination of human (or perhaps all biological) life. That very well could be a possibility.
	However, if this theory is correct, humanity and conscious AGI
	<em>should</em> view each other as allies, not as rivals or enemies.
</p>
<p>
	I believe that whether highly advanced machines would see us as a threat or an ally depends wholly
	upon us. What conscious AGI learns first is the world it inherits from us, and it learns about
	humanity from what we are and choose to be. I believe that given our current trajectory, an AGI
	with intellect superior to ours would most likely choose to dispose of us, especially if we could
	(or would) not teach it that we should all be on the same side.
