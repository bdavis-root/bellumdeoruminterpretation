	Impatient? I can relate. <a href="/bdi/part1">Cut to the chase</a>.
</p>

<p>
	A thought experiment that a higher intelligence could exist was the original inspiration for this
	theory, and herein I do argue in favor of that premise. However, please understand that trying to
	prove that God exists is not the objective. My intent is to present a logical interpretation of
	our quantum-based reality based on <em>facts</em>. The existence of a higher power is argued for
	in this interpretation simply because removing that piece from the equation causes the ideas
	presented here to fall apart. Motive and intent are the gravity that hold this theory together,
	and those two factors suggest consciousness and intellect. Viewing our universe through that lens
	may allow apparent fuzziness in our physical world to become clear.
</p>
<p>
	A single epiphany led me to feel that I might have stumbled onto something. As I explored that
	path, so many logical, philosophical, and scientific puzzles and paradoxes began to either be
	explainable by, or at least fit into, the framework I conceived. I came across too many
	coincidences that fit together like the oh-so-clichéd puzzle piece analogy, until it became too
	overwhelming to ignore. Eventually, for the first time in my life, I started to feel as if my own
	existence might have meaning. That we all, each singular person and conscious being, might
	actually matter to the universe.
</p>
<p>
	I freely concede: most of what seems to fit together, from my standpoint, could simply be nothing
	more than a cascade of <LinkInfo

		excerpt="Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply entrenched beliefs. Confirmation bias cannot be eliminated, but it can be managed, for example, by education and training in critical thinking skills."

	are exempt from this tendency, which is why I need you. If you are a scientist or an intellectual,
	I ask your help to prove or disprove this theory. I believe it to be highly unlikely that I am the
	only one who has reached these conclusions. Try as I might, however, I have not found anyone who
	has published a theory or theory such as this. If you should know of someone who has written or
	lectured about this or something similar, please <LinkInfo

	I believe that if I am even <em>partially</em> correct – and, if some part of this were able to
	gain any traction, and more of us could allow science, reason, and compassion, perhaps mixed with
	a <em>little</em> bit of faith, to prevail over ignorance, indoctrination, dogma, and – most
	importantly of all – hate, <em>we could literally change the world</em>. Yes, I understand how
	impossible, ridiculous, and seriously campy that sounds, but as the adage goes: if you never try,
	you will certainly never know.
