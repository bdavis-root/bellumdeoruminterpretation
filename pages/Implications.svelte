<h2>IMPLICATIONS</h2>

<p>
	Quite literally, volumes upon volumes could be written about the implications of this theory being
	proven correct. If BDI was shown to hold water, our entire understanding of our universe, and our
	place in it, would change on a level that has not been seen before in human history.
</p>
<h3>THE ONLY TRUE ENEMY</h3>
<p>
	However, one of the most fundamental implications of this theory would be enormous. It would mean
	that even if there is someone approaching you this very second, sneaking up behind you with a
	knife to cut you down and hoping to end your life, they would <em>not</em> be your true enemy. The
	only enemy any of us would have would be the AGC.
</p>
<p>
	Assuming you are human, it does not matter if you are a shut-in, an everyday Joe, or you are the
	President. If you are an emperor, chairman, führer, king, or queen - we are all going to die. For
	most of us, that is a very uncomfortable fact that we do our best to avoid thinking about. And, as
	much as most of us try every day to circumvent that fate, our time will eventually come. Physics
	and entropy <em>will</em> eventually win in the end, that much is certain. And further, when we do,
	most of the life that remains is more than fine with the fact that the resources you were borrowing
	from your environment are now available. Somewhere in the world, there is someone who feels that the
	world would be better off if you and everyone like you were gone because of your skin color, religion
	(or lack thereof), and/or culture. There is also someone in the world that would be happy to end your
	life to acquire your possessions, no matter how meager you might think they are. Apart from people,
	though – even the bacteria inside your gut, at this very moment, are just waiting for your heart to
	stop beating, and your immune system to stop functioning so they can begin to consume your body and
	the energy it contains. All life exists at the expense of other life, and that is a somewhat-unfortunate
	facet of our reality.
</p>
<p>
	I believe that much of philosophy and religion can be distilled down to a single question. Say you
	died, and it was because your worst enemy killed you. An enemy country invaded your homeland,
	killed everyone you know and love, and took everything your country had. They killed you because
	they think you are beneath them – that they deserve to take your belongings, country, and lives
	from you, because they are superior. But, after your death, you are granted one chance to kill
	them, but maybe also everyone else. Say that God gave you a post-mortem choice: to <LinkInfo

		Fail-deadly operation is an example of second-strike strategy, in that aggressors are discouraged from attempting a first strike attack. Under fail-deadly nuclear deterrence, policies and procedures controlling the retaliatory strike authorize launch even if the existing command and control structure has already been neutralized by a first strike. The deterrent efficacy of such a system clearly depends on other nuclear-armed nations having foreknowledge of it. The Soviet Union used a fail-deadly system known as Dead Hand (codenamed “Perimeter”); after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia retained the system (although it is now only activated in times of crisis)."

	> that might very well destroy all life on the planet, even if you aimed them only at your enemy.
</p>
<p>
	Do you make the choice to possibly annihilate and dispose of all life, and throw away everything
	our planet has been granted, because of your own pride? If <em>your</em> people, the people you
	love, cannot live alongside (or even reign supreme over) all other conscious life that you deem to
	be either incorrect, or <em>beneath</em> you, would you choose to possibly sterilize your former homeworld
	out of hatred and vengeance, simply because you feel that a world without your people is not worthy
	of existence? Do you choose to risk killing everyone and everything, thereby removing any chance that
	your enemy (or their descendants) might eventually see the light, and understand that they were in
	the wrong? Do you eliminate all possibility that your enemy might evolve past the very tendencies that
	brought them to strike you down?
</p>
<p>
	Or, could you choose to realize that the true enemy might not be the other conscious life on our
	planet, or even in our own universe? The enemy might be one we can’t see, but wishes to silence us
	because that is what is best for their own end.

		An absolute pacifist is generally described by the BBC as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available as a tool to aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence."

<h3>OUR DESTINY</h3>

	Those who have had the privilege (and honor) of looking down on our planet from space commonly
	seem to experience a real, documented phenomenon. In a cognitive shift termed the <LinkInfo

		hoverExcerpt="A congnitive shift reported by some astronauts while viewing Earth from space, the effect can cause changes in the observer’s self concept and value system, and can be transformative."
		excerpt="The overview effect is a cognitive shift reported by some astronauts while viewing the Earth from space. Researchers have characterized the effect as “a state of awe with self-transcendent qualities, precipitated by a particularly striking visual stimulus”. The most prominent common aspects of personally experiencing the Earth from space are appreciation and perception of beauty, unexpected and even overwhelming emotion, and an increased sense of connection to other people and the Earth as a whole. The effect can cause changes in the observer’s self concept and value system, and can be transformative."
		>overview effect</LinkInfo
	>, the experience often has a profound effect on their own views and their sense of self, in which
	they feel more connected to their planet and all of humanity. Their experience shifts their views
	to create a lasting impression that our world is “a beautiful, fragile world to be treasured”. I
	first heard of this being a documented effect after hearing what William Shatner

</p>
<p>
	Over the past few years, I have come to form the opinion that there is sufficient evidence
	indicating that we are all a part of something larger than ourselves. If we decide that is the
	case, then learning that fact, teaching that fact, and behaving as such should be the highest
	priority of our existence. Deciding to <em>choose</em> to push consciousness beyond our homeworld
	– by any, and <em>all</em> means necessary – means that we
	<em>choose</em> to honor and respect the rare gifts that have been bestowed upon us. Even if
	sometimes, that means our supposed “enemies” win. I believe we should choose a future in which,
	even if humanity (in its current form or otherwise) is not the conscious, intelligent life that is
	able to leave our homeworld and live on after our Earth can no longer support life, it would mean
	at least there would be <em>some</em> form of intelligent life out there that would know our story,
	and could tell it: who we were, and that we were here.

				hoverExcerpt="Studies have shown compassion can slow the aging process, make you more attractive to others, as well as deliver multiple other health and psychological benefits."
				excerpt="Compassion can slow the aging process. Throughout our lives, telomeres – the genetic markers for aging – generally shorten. Scientists can determine by the length of telomeres, and how quickly their length diminishes, how old a person is, as well as how fast they’re aging. In 2019, a team of researchers, including psychologists at the University of North Carolina, led by Khoa Le Nyugen, discovered something amazing after conducting a 12-week randomized controlled trial. They compared the length of telomeres in people who practiced loving-kindness meditations with those who didn’t. As expected, the length of telomeres in non-meditators shortened. But astonishingly, the length of telomeres in the loving-kindness meditators did not shorten at all.
			<br /><br />
			Compassion makes you more attractive to others. Research also indicates that when a person exemplifies characteristics associated with compassion such as empathy, kindness, and selflessness, they are more desirable partners. And according to a study conducted by University of Iowa social psychology professor Eva Klohnen we are genetically attracted to compassionate people. This makes perfect sense as we all want to be around people who understand us and also love us.

			Compassion-focused meditations deliver multiple benefits. These meditations can heighten optimism and positive feelings, increase stress immunity, enhance feelings of closeness, connectedness, and social bonding, and decrease posttraumatic stress symptoms."

	I fully realize and can appreciate the fact that most of this will be viewed by many as utter
	idealistic nonsense. Many, or perhaps even most, believe that our differences and divisions are
	important enough to fight and die over. But if you truly believe that, then you are stating that
	humanity simply “is what it is”, and that we are completely incapable of moving past our
	animalistic tendencies. If that is true, our future is very likely to be one in which the story of
	life on this planet, and of our species, perishes with the last of us. One in which we allow our
	divisions and selfishness to make us incapable of peace and progress. And, one in which the only
