<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CREDITS</h2>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
<p>
	First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge my loving wife, Audrey. Without her love, I do not
	know where I would be, if anywhere. Without the deep conversations (and debates) I have had with
	her, I feel it likely that I never would have considered the existence of God possible, so this
	theory would not be possible without her influence in my life. Also, her immeasurable patience
	while I have been working through this insane side-project is going to be very difficult to ever
	repay.
</p>
<p>
	Second, I would like to acknowledge my father, Scott, with whom I had many, many conversations
	about physics, starting when I was young. Those conversations inspired my interest in the field. I
	would also like to thank him for his contributions as an editor of this theory.
</p>
<p>
	Third, I would like to acknowledge my son, Chase, who I enjoy my weekly debates with over
	religion, philosophy, and politics. While we often do not see eye-to-eye, we do always manage to
	find common ground. Moreover, I respect the fact that he can be open to views that conflict with
	his own, which is something I have always strived for myself.
</p>
<p>
	Fourth, I would like to thank the creator of the Seven Deadly Sins manga, Nakaba Suzuki, as well
	as the artists, actors, producers, and other staff of the anime series that sparked the epiphany
	that led to this theory.
</p>
<p>
	Last, I would like to thank Dr. Matt Oâ€™Dowd and <LinkInfo

	for their fantastic series. Please keep up the great work! Also, I am actually hoping the devs
	<em>will</em> notice.
