<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
	First off, I’d like to start with a <strong>TRIGGER WARNING</strong>. I will be talking about
	religion. If something comes across as sarcastic, please accept that it is just my version of
	humor. It is truly not my intention to offend anyone. I believe almost every major religion on
	Earth owns a portion of “the truth”. That said, there are some elements of religious books and
	teachings that run in direct conflict with what this theory predicts to be “the truth”, and I will
	be addressing a few of those conflicts.
</p>
<p>
	Next, I must warn that in order to understand the contents of this theory, you must understand, at
	an introductory level, two scientific concepts that seem extremely bizarre to many when they first
	learn about them: <LinkInfo

	>. If you know nothing about these concepts, you can follow these links. Yes, I realize there are
	a lot of videos and it will take you a little while to get through them. If you are starting from
	zero and wish to truly understand reality, you must do the work and educate yourself! Also, if
	your worldview causes you to refuse to accept basic scientific truths, such as the

		>climate change</LinkInfo

	overwhelming scientific evidence for these theories that it would be nearly inconceivable that any
	of them could be proven incorrect. With that said, this theory does align with

	The next warning is this: The ideas herein are unorthodox, but I feel their novelty makes them
	worth considering. In order to fully understand the theory and the reasoning that led me here, you
	will likely need to read this theory in its entirety, as well as follow the links presented (if
	you lack understanding of a concept). I realize there are links <em>everywhere</em>. That is
	because I don't want to assume any reader's education level or familiarity with physics, and also
	to provide reference and support for the ideas presented.

	I composed this (first) version in a very non-academic manner, as I feel these ideas can reach a
	much wider audience in this format. If this theory is not disproven immediately, an academic
	version will be written in due course; for now, I feel it important that these ideas are
	digestible by as many people and as quickly as possible, for reasons I shall discuss. This
	interpretation is broken into two parts. The first has much more scientific ground to stand on,
	and I am highly confident that it could explain our universe. Part II currently has less evidence
	to stand on and is, admittedly, more of my own intuition.

	regarded likewise (at least initially). I knew that both men had made significant contributions to
	the field of physics. However, I only learned about their viewpoints on how the quantum world
	relates to consciousness <em>after</em> I began forming this theory. I believe they were on the right
	track and, further, that these two brilliant men's contributions are being wrongfully dismissed. I
	want to be clear: compared to these two, I am no more than a 1950s toddler pointing at a globe, excited
	that South America and Africa look as if they could fit together.

		hoverExcerpt="Proposed solutions to measurement in quantum mechanics regarding how the classical world emerges from quantum theory."
		excerpt="Objective-collapse theories, also known as models of spontaneous wave function collapse or dynamical reduction models, are proposed solutions to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. As with other theories called interpretations of quantum mechanics, they are possible explanations of why and how quantum measurements always give definite outcomes, not a superposition of them as predicted by the Schrödinger equation, and more generally how the classical world emerges from quantum theory. The fundamental idea is that the unitary evolution of the wave function describing the state of a quantum system is approximate. It works well for microscopic systems, but progressively loses its validity when the mass / complexity of the system increases."

	conscious being (in the universe) is observing. I tend to side with Einstein when he said, “I like
	to think the moon is there even if I am not looking at it.”
